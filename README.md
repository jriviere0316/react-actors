## Description




## Requirements
Your react application should have five components.

App.js
Header.js
About.js
Contact.js
Footer.js

Header.js
[x] Should contain an h1 that says React Actors

About.js
[x] Should contain an h2 that says About and a paragraph describing the organization.

Contact.js
[x] Should contain an h2 that says Contact, a paragraph with the phone number, and a paragraph with the email.

Footer.js
[x] Should contain a copyright Â© React Actors (don't worry about the symbol if you can't get it working, but you should be able to copy and paste it).


Stretch Goals
We need to let new people join the react actors. Watch this clip to see what we would like from the form. (This form will not actually add anything to a list, it's a proof of concept that simply alerts the result.)

[x] A sentence should appear below the form that says who the person is and their best impression.
[x]This sentence should display only if all three fields have values. (Research conditional rendering.)
[x]An alert should say thank you and then the first name
The form should clear after click
